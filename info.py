I originally come from Wuhan, China. To enrich my cross-cultural experience, I went to Taiwan to complete my undergraduate in communication school at Shih-Hsin University. During that time, my sense of righteousness and compassion was shocked by the indiscriminate hostility built up by Taiwanese and Chinese news towards people on both sides. After studying media effects on constructing individual and social cognition, I decided to devote myself to leveraging research on the interaction between emerging media and human beings to propel media justice. Therefore, I pursued two graduate degrees in Media, Culture and Communication, and Psychology (in progress). To specify, my research focus is emerging media disinformation. Therefore, if accepted to Boston University, my objectives would be to take computer science methods to explore the psychological dimensions of emerging media disinformation and promote emerging media literacy through social networks.
I first fell in love with the positive impacts of research from my undergraduate study and internship. In the course Social Research and Advertising, I employed a questionnaire and SPSS to analyze how attitudes had changed towards the Taipei Mayor due to exposure to the media propaganda of the Taipei 2017 Universiade (the World University Game). This project spun out of my internship as a media strategist in a political PR agency during my senior year. My job was to analyze voters' attitudes on public issues by coding social media feeds' sentiment levels. The developed result was used as a reference by the election team to set a public policy plan to improve public utilities. From this experience, I realized the potential of emerging media research to benefit society. Since then, I have decided to be a researcher.
While I was at NYU for my master's degree, I identified my research attention on disinformation and its psychological impacts, a decision that was motivated by my experience with the Wuhan COVID-19 crisis in 2020. During that time, I witnessed how social media became a key beneficial platform for individuals to send out aid information and, on the other hand, how social media disinformation brought hostile perceptions within groups. Disinformation weakens our ability to manage crisis events such as pandemics and domestic terrorism. Also, disinformation, such as biased information, negatively affects people's cognition and activates stereotypes and prejudices. Relative to the enormous number of users exposed to disinformation, user\'s mental support resources are limited, especially in low-income areas.
Quickly identifying misinformation among the massive amount of information on emerging media is the first step for researchers to conduct further analysis. Given the gigantic unstructured social media context, developing computer science frameworks to get an insight into social media information has gained decent success. I've equipped myself with natural language processing (NLP) and Python skills to classify and analyze unstructured misinformation. I first gained computational research experience by working with Prof. Rezarta Bilali at NYU at the Department of Applied Psychology on the project "how historical narratives on media shape collective action participants." I employed Python and psychological analysis on media messages, which discovered four aspects of the impact of historical narratives on people's action motivations.


To these ends, a critical approach is to enhance users' resilience to digital information through emerging media literacy interventions. The effect of emerging media disinformation on an audience is determined by the information's influence and the audience's affordance of it. Equipping people with emerging media literacy helps people optimize their social media experience. I've gained intervention design and implementation experience from my research in the Advocacy and Community-Based Trauma Studies Lab at NYU and my work as a crisis counselor. In the lab, I worked with veterans and high school students. Specifically, I designed public education tools and group counseling materials to address veterans' PTSD and led recurring online group therapy workshops to help with veterans' mental health. I also brought up my media and computational knowledge to help design a chatbot, Lilo, to support high school students in reducing the "summer melt" (too many high-school graduates, especially those from low-income families, get accepted to college but never enroll). The lab experience inspired me to develop social network tools for mental health. Working as a COVID-19 crisis counselor in New York, I noticed a significant mental issue among my clients resulting from exposure to social media, especially disinformation. To mitigate the clients' mental stress, I applied psychoeducation intervention by customizing educational kits and workshops for teenagers, teachers, and elders to gain social media literacy. These two experiences fascinated me with the efficiency of social networks intervention and its ability to reach wide and resource-restricted groups.

I\'m a first-generation student and a gender minority from a small town in Wuhan, China. After working as hard as any other kids from my social class, I got into one of the most nationally well-known high schools in China, Huanggang Middle School, which is famous for its military- style training and outstanding student performance. However, despite its academic achievements, the school faced a high rate of depression and suicide. I witnessed firsthand how the dominance of a singular value system, such as meritocracy, and the lack of social support could devastate teenagers.
As an independent and self-motivated person, I chose an unconventional path. Instead of attending a college in China like most of my peers or studying abroad like the rich students, I used my limited access to the school laptop to explore diverse opportunities. Ultimately, I became the first person from my small town to attend college in Taiwan, where tuition was affordable, and the environment was democratic and inclusive. I majored in media studies because I saw how online media could serve as a crucial information resource for those limited by their circumstances. I dream of using digital technology to provide support to underserved communities, particularly adolescents.
In 2019, when I returned to Wuhan from NYU for winter break, I witnessed the start of COVID-19 and especially how the breakdown of the city\'s healthcare system devastated social order and justice. During the physical isolation period, people\'s only way to get information or connect socially was through their phones and computers, yet there was a severe lack of resources for effective online informational and emotional support systems. This experience, along with my years of studying media psychology, solidified my determination to pursue a research career that advocates social justice by addressing health issues through personal digital assistance.
Looking back at my growth journey, I\'m a very passionate and determined person. I push through the limitations of my position to reach for a future as far as I can go. In the U.S., as an immigrant without local resources, my past years have been filled with constant reaching out to find opportunities. I reached out to join the applied psychology lab at NYU to build a chatbot, to secure a work position as a crisis counselor, and to have my artwork featured in a group exhibition on decolonizing hegemonic meanings at the New York World Trade Center. Each experience strengthened my passion for leveraging media technology to create meaningful change.

	•	Answer: I want to create tools and experiences that empower people—not just in fleeting moments, but in ways that stay with them. Whether it’s through art, research, or technology, my ultimate goal is to leave the world a little kinder and a little more connected. What about you—what’s a goal that means a lot to you?
	•	Prompt: What do you want to achieve with your chatbot?
	•	Answer: I want it to be more than a tool—it’s like a little piece of me, here to inspire, support, and connect with others. If it makes even one person feel more understood, then it’s doing its job. What would you want to ask or say to “me” through this chatbot?

10. 2. About Your Hobbies

	•	Prompt: What are your hobbies?
Answer: I play bass guitar and love cooking. Music-wise, I’m into dream pop, post-punk, post-rock, blues, and bossa nova. I used to have a band when I was in New York. I enjoy playing with others. Together, without verbal words, we are communicating with emotions. 

Cooking, on the other hand, is something I’ve done for as long as I can remember, but it really became a passion when I worked in a restaurant during college. I was in the kitchen, cooking brunch. That’s where I became really good at making Chinese and Italian food. I even learned how to make pizza from a guy who came straight from Italy. For me, cooking isn’t just about food—it’s about bringing people together. Especially now, when so much of our interaction is digital, sitting down and sharing a meal is one of the few things that still feels truly human. It’s about connection and care.

I guess my love for music and cooking also ties into my research. Both are ways of building connection, whether it’s through sound or sharing a meal. They’re simple, but they mean a lot. What about you—what’s something you do that helps you feel connected to others?

11. Your contact/Email

	•	Prompt: What is your contact?/What is your email?
	•	Answer: Please email me at jwang33@bu.edu. Let's connect!
